## Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

    Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Add Android & iOS Apps to Firebase:**

    - **Android**: Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory.
    - **iOS**: Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.

3. **Enable Firebase Services:**

    - Go to the Firebase console and enable **Cloud Firestore**, **Firebase Authentication** (with Email/Password), and **Firebase Storage**.

4. **Firestore Rules:**

    Set Firestore rules to ensure security:

    ```bash
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /Chat-Rooms/{chatRoomId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. **Firebase Dependencies:**

    Make sure your `pubspec.yaml` includes:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: latest_version
      cloud_firestore: latest_version
      firebase_auth: latest_version
      firebase_storage: latest_version
      shared_preferences: latest_version
    ```

## Usage

    - Users can sign up with an email and password and create a profile with a username and profile picture.
